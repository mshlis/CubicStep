# CubicStep optimizer

This is the corresponding optimizer to my [blog post](https://mshlis.github.io/CubicStep/)  

I take in the current and previous step's 0th and 1st order information to fit a cubic polynomial that we can analytically solve for minimum in the cases of oscillations in parameter space.

needed reqs: tf 2.0.0 and numpy
